EasyDerivSteps is a free program that takes derivatives step-by-step,
showing explanations in blue and highlighting in red the parts of the 
expression that have changed since the previous step. It is preloaded with 
the basic rules of differentiation including the constant rule, sum rule, 
product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, and power rule. It also knows the 
derivatives of trigonometric, inverse-trigonometric, exponential, square-root,
and logarithmic functions. Finally, it is preloaded with close to 100 rules
of algebraic simplification, which allow it to cancel-out or group common 
terms in expressions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the Windows build. It is known to run on Windows XP and later, but 
it might run on earlier versions of Windows as well.

It might take a few seconds for the program to start up on its first launch.

The program's user interface should be mostly self-explanatory. There is 
a "Help" button if issues arise. 

Feel free to send bug reports, comments, criticism, etc. to me via my email, 
    bl0ckedusersoft@gmail.com

Updates, alternative versions, etc. can be found at the program's homepage:
    https://sites.google.com/site/bl0ckeduserssoftware/easyderivsteps

Updates are planned, in particular with respect to the program's algebraic
simplifications capabilities, which are still deficient in some areas.

The source code for part of the program can be found at 
    https://github.com/bl0ckeduser/symdiff
The whole program may be open-sourced at some point.

This program makes use of the software technologies emscripten, MathJax,
and XULRunner. It also uses icons created by Oxygen Team. Further 
details on this can be found by clicking on the "About" button.
