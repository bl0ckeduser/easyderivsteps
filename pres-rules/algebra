% Some basic cancelling-out
A + -1 * A = 0
A + -A = 0
A - A = 0
-A + A = 0
A + -A = 0
A / A = 1
; Cancel out *A divided by itself

(A * B + C) / (A * A) = B/A + C/(A * A)
; Cancel out *A from left-hand term of numerator

1 / A * B = B / A

(A + B * C) / C = A/C + B
; Cancel out *C

(A / B) / C = A / (B * C)

0 / u = 0

0 * u = 0

u / 1 = u

(x^n)*(b/x) = x^(n-1)*b

#a * ((#b * C) / D) = (a * b * C) / D
